Font obtained from https://www.fontyukle.net/font/White-Rabbit
Author listed there is I Shot the Serif
Sadly, the "text file" mentioned in the license was not included there, so I can't include an unmodified version of it here.
This is my best effort at reproducing it:

White Rabbit, like all of my fonts, is free. You can use it for most personal or business uses you'd like, and I ask for no money. I would, however, like to hear from you. If you use my fonts for something please send me a postcard or e-mail letting me know how you used it. Send me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work.

You may use this font for graphical or printed work, but you may not sell it or include it in a collection of fonts (on CD or otherwise) being sold. You can redistribute this font as long as you charge nothing to receive it. If you redistribute it include this text file with it as is (without modifications).

If you use this font for commercial purposes please credit me in at least some little way.
